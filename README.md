# SilverHorseInterviewApi

## Running the API

### Requirements
- .NET 6.0 Runtime
- ASP.NET Core Runtime >=6.0
- .NET 6.0 Hosting bundle (Deployment)
- IIS Features turned on (Windows settings)
### Dev
If the above requirements are met, running a dev build should be as straight forward as opening the `SilverHorseInterviewApi.sln` pressing `F5`, starting up the Kestrel web server and opening the Swagger UI to test out the API. You can plug in the bearer token into the Swagger UI in the top left by clicking the `Authorize` button. You can also run with IIS Express and a self signed cert.
